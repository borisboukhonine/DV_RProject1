This is our R markdown file for project 1 for Dr. Cannata's Data Vis class. Here we document our steps in creating our plots.


```{r}
source("../01 Data/package_loader.R", echo = TRUE)
```
loaded the packages


```{r}
source("../01 Data/project1_dataframes.R", echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
head(df_customers)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
