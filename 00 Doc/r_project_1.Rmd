This is our R markdown file for project 1 for Dr. Cannata's Data Vis class. Here we document our steps in creating our plots.


```{r}
source("../01 Data/package_loader.R", echo = TRUE)
```
loaded the packages


```{r}
source("../01 Data/project1_dataframes.R", echo = TRUE)
head(df_customers)
head(df_orders)
head(df_order_details)
head(df_items)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=df_customers)+geom_histogram(aes(x=CUSTOMER_STATE, fill=CUSTOMER_STATE))

ggplot(data=df_order_details)+geom_histogram(aes(x=ITEM_ID))
ggplot(df_items, aes(x=ARTIST, y=UNIT_PRICE, color=TITLE))+geom_point()

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
